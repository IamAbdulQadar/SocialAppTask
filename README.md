# Project Overview
SocialAppTask is a simple social app developed to meet a company’s requirements. Built entirely using Swift, UIKit, and Auto Layout, it follows the VIPER architecture while adhering to clean coding practices.

The app consists of two main screens:

PostListView – Displays a list of posts from multiple static users.
CreatePostView – Allows users to add new posts.

This project demonstrates modern Swift development practices, ensuring a clean, modular, and maintainable codebase.

# External Dependecy Requirement
This app is developed entirely using native technologies and does not rely on any third-party libraries.
On the first launch, the app will not display any posts.
Users must add a post first, which will then appear in the main listing screen.


# Key Features
